# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI - official Windows MSI installer.
# Downloaded at install time directly from the oracle/oci-cli GitHub releases
# and verified against the SHA256 Oracle publishes in the release notes.
# See tools\VERIFICATION.txt for how to reproduce the checksum.
#
# The MSI is built with cx_Freeze: it bundles its own Python runtime, installs
# to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle\oci_cli\", and prepends that directory to the
# system PATH (so 'oci' works in new shells). A silent /qn install applies all
# of this with no prompts; uninstalling removes the PATH entry again.
